File Name: MarketingAnalytics_Churn Analysis
Description: This Jupyter Notebook contains a comprehensive analysis of customer churn using marketing analytics techniques. 
The analysis includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and the application of various machine learning models to predict customer churn. 
The notebook also provides detailed visualizations to help understand key factors contributing to churn, along with model performance metrics to evaluate the effectiveness of the predictive models. 
This document is intended for use in improving customer retention strategies by identifying at-risk customers and suggesting actionable insights based on the analysis.

Marketing Analytics - Churn Analysis Project

Objective:
The primary objective of this project is to analyze customer churn and build predictive models that can identify customers at risk of leaving. The analysis aims to provide actionable insights to help improve customer retention strategies.

Steps Performed:

Data Collection and Import:

The dataset used for the churn analysis was imported into the Jupyter Notebook. It contains various customer attributes such as demographics, service usage, account information, and customer support interactions.
Data Preprocessing:

Data Cleaning: Handled missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies in the data. This involved filling missing data using statistical methods or dropping irrelevant columns.
Feature Encoding: Categorical variables were encoded using techniques like one-hot encoding to make them suitable for machine learning models.
Normalization/Standardization: Continuous variables were normalized or standardized to ensure they contribute equally to the modelâ€™s performance.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Data Visualization: Various plots and graphs (e.g., histograms, box plots, correlation heatmaps) were generated to understand the distribution of data, relationships between features, and the impact of different variables on customer churn.
Correlation Analysis: Analyzed correlations between features to identify significant predictors of churn.
Feature Engineering:

Creation of New Features: Developed new features based on domain knowledge to enhance the predictive power of the models. Examples might include tenure categories, customer segmentation based on usage patterns, or interaction frequency.
Feature Selection: Selected the most relevant features for the model based on their importance, correlation with the target variable (churn), and multicollinearity checks.
Modeling:

Model Selection: Multiple machine learning models were evaluated for predicting customer churn, including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM).
Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimized model parameters using techniques such as Grid Search or Random Search to improve model performance.
Model Training: Trained the models on the preprocessed dataset, using cross-validation to prevent overfitting and to ensure the model generalizes well to unseen data.
Model Evaluation: The models were evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and AUC-ROC curve. The best-performing model was selected based on these metrics.
Results Interpretation:

Feature Importance: Analyzed the importance of each feature in the final model to understand what factors are driving customer churn.
Prediction Interpretation: Generated churn probability scores for each customer, which can be used by the marketing team to target retention efforts.
Deployment and Recommendations:

Model Deployment: Suggested ways to deploy the model into a production environment, such as integrating with customer relationship management (CRM) systems to automate churn prediction.
Strategic Recommendations: Based on the analysis, provided recommendations for reducing churn, such as targeted marketing campaigns, personalized offers, and improved customer service for high-risk customers.
Conclusion:
The project successfully developed a predictive model for customer churn, offering valuable insights into customer behavior and key drivers of churn. These insights can be leveraged by the marketing and customer service teams to proactively address churn and improve overall customer retention.
